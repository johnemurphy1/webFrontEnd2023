Angular Services
================
A service is used to interact with APIs. 
All services are decorated with @Injectable which means they are available to all components
They have no template since they do not have concerns about how data is displayed
We will
- make a new project
- architect it with components
- add a service
In this project, the user will be able to select a category and an id from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
Then the service will use the specified category and id to retrieve some JSON
We show the retrieved JSON on the page

Services require us to use Typescript
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/

First we need a new project (with no routing)
- ng new use-api-proj
- cd use-api-proj (remember to change into our new project folder)
Then we need a component
ng g c photos
Open app.component.html and delete everything
Then add some structure and an instance of our 'my-form' component
    <article>
        <section>
            <app-photos></app-photos>
        </section>
    </article>

Next we need to generate a service called 'typicode'
- ng generate service typicode              (or ng g s typicode)
You now have a file called 'typicode-service.ts' so open it and take a look
All services are decorated with @Injectable
The purpose of our service will be to communicate with an API end-point
See https://angular.io/guide/http-server-communication
In this case we will use the free API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
It lets us ask for a category and an id then returns a load of JSON
In order for Angular to communicate over HTTP we must configure something in NgModule:
- Open app.module.ts (this is the NgModule for our project)
- Edit the imports array so it reads:
    BrowserModule, HttpClientModule, FormsModule
- We also added the FormsModule so we can use form fields in Angular
Make sure the HttpClientModule and FormsModule are correctly imported at the top of this file
- at the top it should say:
    import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
We have now provided the tools for Angular to interact with external APIs over HTTP
In particular, we will be able to use 'HttpClient' in our service
We are now ready to start implementing methods of our (client-side) service
Return to typicode.service.ts
The conventional way to enable a service to use Http is
    constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
That will instantiate the Angular 'HttpClient' as a variable called 'http' (or whatever you want to call it)
We can now use it in methods. Inside the TypicodeService class write:
  apiUrl = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`
  getAllPhotos(){
      try {
        return this.http.get(`${this.apiUrl}/photos`)
      }
      catch (err) {
        return new Observable()
      }
  } 
You will need to make sure Angular imports 'Observable' from 'rxjs'
    import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
Now we can use this method of our service
Return to photos.component.ts
- add a property ccalled 'photos' which is an empty array
    photos = []
- add a constructor which instantiates our service
    constructor(private typicode:TypicodeService){}
- add a method called 'handlePhotos' which will populate the array with the dat from the service
    handlePhotos(){
        return (received:any)=>{
            this.photos = received
        }
    }
- add an 'ngOnInit' method which calls our 'handlePhotos' method when the component first loads
    ngOnInit(){
        this.typicode.getAllPhotos()
            .subscribe( this.handlePhotos() )
    }
We need to show the photos array in the photos template
- open photos.component.html
- add some basic html
    <section>
        <pre>{{photos |json}}</pre>
    </section>
Run the app and enjoy the data
    ng serve    (then open a browser at http://localhost:4200)

For a better view of the data, change the template like this:
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li *ngFor="let photo of photos">
                Title {{photo['title']}}
                ID {{photo['id']}} Album ID {{photo['albumId']}} URL {{photo['thumbnailUrl']}}
                <img [src]="photo['thumbnailUrl']" [alt]="photo['title']" [title]="photo['title']"/>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

Passing Arguments to the back-end API
-------------------------------------
We can add parameters to the API request. In this case, we will send a category and an id
We will need a component for the user to enter data:
- ng g c my-form
Add an instance of <app-my-form> to app.component.html
Delete all content from the template my-form.component.html
Then write a nice form like this:
    <form>
        <label for="cats">Category: </label>
        <select id="cats" name="cats" [(ngModel)]="category">
            <option *ngFor="let cat of categories">{{cat}}</option>
        </select> 
        <label for="cat_id">ID: </label>
        <input id="cat_id" name="cat_id" ngDebounce
        [(ngModel)]="category_id"
        placeholder="enter ID"
        required
        type="number" min="1" max="10" #cat_id="ngModel" />
        <button (click)="handleForm()" >Go</button>
    </form>
We will want to see the returned data so for now, under the form write this:
        <hr/>
        <!-- use the JSON pipe for easy visualization -->
        <pre>{{dataModel|json}}</pre>

Now we need a method in the service. Inside typicode.service.ts add this method:
  getCatAndId(cat: string, cat_id: number) {
    if (typeof (cat) == 'string' && typeof (cat_id) == 'number') {
      const urlCatId = `${this.apiUrl}/${cat}/${cat_id}`
      // every Angular service should return an Observable
      try {
        return this.http.get(urlCatId) // Angular wll make sure this is an Observable
      }
      catch (err) {
        return new Observable()
      }
    } else {
      return new Observable() // we must return something
    }
  }
Next we call this service method from the button on the form in the template
Inside my-form.component.ts (see following code):
- instantiate the service in the constructor
- set some properties
- write some methods

    export class MyFormComponent {
    // properties
    categories = ['users', 'posts', 'albums', 'photos', 'todos']
    category = this.categories[0]
    category_id = 1
    // we can make a TS Interface for our model
    dataModel = {'name':'', 'thumbnailUrl':''}
    // methods
    constructor(private typicode:TypicodeService){}

    // every component has lifecycle events
    ngOnInit(){ // fires when the component is first rendered
        this.handleForm()
    }
    
    handleForm(){
        this.typicode.getCatAndId(this.category, this.category_id)
        .subscribe( this.handleReturnedData() )
    }
    
    handleReturnedData(){
        return (received:any)=>{
        this.dataModel = received
        }
    }
    }

Now you can choose a category and an id then click the button to retrieve related data
This example goes no further with rendering the returned data, but you could nicely present the data
